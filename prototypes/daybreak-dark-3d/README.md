# Daybreak Dark 3D Theme

Dark mode 3D variant combining floating cubes with a deep, glowing aesthetic.

## Design Philosophy

This theme merges the floating 3D elements of Daybreak 3D with the dark, atmospheric palette of Daybreak Dark. Cubes glow softly against the dark background, creating depth through light rather than shadow.

## Color Palette

| Role | Color | Hex |
|------|-------|-----|
| Background Primary | Near Black | `#0a0a0b` |
| Background Surface | Dark Gray | `#111113` |

| Accent Primary | Coral | `#ff5757` |

## Key Visual Elements

- **Glowing 3D cubes** — Cubes with colored glow effects
- **Radial gradients** — Ambient color pools in background
- **Border accents** — Subtle light borders on cards and inputs
- **Glow shadows** — `box-shadow` with accent color glow

## Technical Notes

3D cubes use brighter RGB values for visibility:
- Primary: `255, 87, 87` (coral)
- Secondary: `129, 140, 248` (indigo)
- Tertiary: `161, 161, 170` (gray)
