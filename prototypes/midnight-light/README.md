# Midnight Light

**Mood:** Clean Tech

The electric particle aesthetic of Midnight, translated to a light background. Futuristic and clean rather than dark and cyber.

## Visual Identity

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Background | `#f8f9fc` (cool white) |
| Surface | `#ffffff` |
| Primary Accent | `#00b8e6` (deeper cyan for contrast) |
| Secondary Accent | `#e6006a` (deeper magenta for contrast) |
| Headline Text | `#0a0a14` |
| Body Text | `#5a5a6a` |

## Typography

- **Headlines:** Space Grotesk, 700 weight, tight letter-spacing
- **Body:** Inter, 400 weight, line-height 1.6
- **Accents:** Uppercase, tracked out, smaller size for labels

## Hero Visual: Particle Flow System

Same particle physics and behavior as Midnight, adjusted for light background:

- Particles use deeper cyan/magenta for visibility on white
- Glow effect reduced (lower shadowBlur values)
- Connection lines use darker opacity (`rgba(0, 184, 230, 0.3)`)
- Edge fade adjusted for light background

## Interaction Style

| Element | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| Cards | Subtle shadow expansion on hover (not glow) |
| Primary Button | Cyan fill, dark text |
| Secondary Button | Cyan outline on white |
| Navigation | Frosted white with backdrop blur |
| Dividers | Gradient lines (cyan → magenta) |

## Scroll Animations

- Sections fade up with 20px translate
- Staggered timing on card grids
- Same easing as Midnight

## Design Rationale

The electric/tech aesthetic works on light by becoming "clean tech" — the particles feel like data flowing through a pristine environment rather than a dark void. Good for audiences who prefer light interfaces but want the dynamic particle effect.
