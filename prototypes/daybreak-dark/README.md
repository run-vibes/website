# Daybreak Dark

**Mood:** Bold Premium

The confident geometric aesthetic of Daybreak, translated to a dark background. Bold and sophisticated rather than bold and accessible.

## Hero Visual: Geometric Shapes

Same SVG shapes and parallax behavior as Daybreak, adjusted for dark:

- Brighter shape fills for contrast on dark background
- Subtle glow/shadow effect added to shapes
- Shapes feel like they're floating on the dark surface
- Mouse parallax unchanged

## Interaction Style

| Element | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| Cards | Dark surface with soft coral/indigo border glow on hover |
| Primary Button | Coral fill, white text |
| Secondary Button | Indigo outline with glow |
| Navigation | Dark with blur, coral accent on CTA |
| Section Backgrounds | Alternating dark tones |

## Scroll Animations

- Sections slide from left/right (alternating)
- Cards scale up on reveal
- Snappy, energetic easing (same as Daybreak)

## Design Rationale

The bold, confident energy translates to dark by becoming "bold premium" — the geometric shapes feel more sophisticated and high-end on dark. Good for audiences who prefer dark interfaces but want the structured, confident feel of Daybreak.
