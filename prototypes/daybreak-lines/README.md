# Daybreak Lines

Daybreak theme with geometric line-based patterns.

## Design Philosophy

This variant uses clean, geometric lines and grids to create visual structure. The linear patterns add sophistication while maintaining the bold, energetic feel of the base Daybreak theme.

## Key Visual Elements

- **Grid patterns** — Subtle background grids for structure
- **Animated lines** — Lines that draw in on scroll
- **Geometric accents** — Line-based decorative elements
- **Clean intersections** — Precise, calculated positioning

## Technical Notes

Lines are created using CSS gradients and pseudo-elements for performance and crisp rendering at all scales.

See `../daybreak/README.md` for base theme details.
