## Hero Visual: Generative Mesh Gradient

WebGL or canvas-based mesh gradient that:

- Continuously morphs between color states (slow, organic transitions)
- Responds to mouse position (colors shift and flow toward cursor)
- Creates an aurora borealis / northern lights effect
- Soft blur and glow create depth without hard edges

## Interaction Style

| Element | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| Cards | Glassmorphism: translucent backgrounds, subtle borders, backdrop blur |
| Primary Button | Gradient fill (purple → teal) |
| Secondary Button | Glass effect (translucent with border) |
| Dividers | Soft gradient fades rather than hard lines |
| Icons | Outlined with gradient strokes |

## Scroll Animations

- Sections emerge with a soft blur-to-clear transition
- Parallax on background gradient (moves slower than content)
- Easing: floating, dreamy curves (longer duration, gentle deceleration)

## Best For
